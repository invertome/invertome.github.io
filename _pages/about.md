Modern medicine and our understanding of the biological world has been heavily influenced by the detailed study of just a handful of organisms. By focusing on only a limited number of species, we have yet to fully unlock the potential of the biological world. Invertebrates, which make up the majority of animal life and have adapted to nearly every ecosystem on Earth, hold a wealth of untapped evolutionary innovation within their genomes and microbiomes. Exploring this potential is the key to advancing to the next age of discovery. This is where InverTome comes in.


A data-driven approach to biological discovery
======

InverTome's goal is to combine individual sequencing efforts into a comprehensive database resource for the scientific community. Many sequencing efforts go unnoticed and unused in archival databases, but InverTome aims to change that by removing technical barriers such as sequence assembly, quality control, and annotation. We aim to provide high-quality digital "Tomes" for every major group of invertebrates across the tree of life. These tomes will be continuously evolving collections of genomic, transcriptomic, and Hidden Markov Model profile datasets that can be employed for a variety of purposes, from gene discovery to functional studies.
