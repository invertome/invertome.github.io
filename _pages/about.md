Modern medicine and our understanding of the biological world has been fueled by studying a handful of organisms in great detail. By examining only a limited number of species, we are yet to harness the full potential that the biological world has to offer. Majority of animal life is comprised of invertebrates that have adapted to almost every known ecosystem on Planet Earth. Exploring the untapped potential of invertebrate genomes & microbiomes is the engine that will transport us to the next age of discovery. Enter InverTome.

A data-driven approach to biological discovery
======

InverTome's goal is to combine individual sequencing efforts into a large database resource for the community. Most sequencing efforts languish in archival databases without being noticed beyond the scope of their original project. By removing technical barriers such as sequence assembly, quality control, and annotation, we aim to provide high-quality digital "Tomes" for every major group of invertebrates across the tree of life. These tomes are a collection of continuously evolving and highly curated genomic and transcriptomic datasets that can be employed for multiple purposes ranging from gene discovery to functional studies.
